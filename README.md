# Task 05: Descriptive Statistics and Large Language Models

## Project Overview
This research project explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analyzing sports datasets and answering natural language questions about descriptive statistics. The goal is to test LLM accuracy, develop effective prompt engineering strategies, and validate LLM responses against actual data analysis.

## Research Objectives
- Test LLM accuracy on basic descriptive statistics questions
- Develop sophisticated prompt engineering techniques for complex analytical questions
- Validate LLM responses against actual data analysis
- Generate visualizations directly from LLMs
- Document the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in sports data analysis

## Dataset
- **Source**: [To be determined - SU sports team or cricket team data]
- **Format**: CSV/JSON
- **Size**: Small dataset to avoid high LLM context costs
- **Focus**: Team performance statistics, player data, game results

## Methodology
1. **Data Processing**: Create scripts to perform baseline descriptive statistics
2. **LLM Testing**: Test multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Co-Pilot) with various prompts
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Develop and refine prompts for complex analytical questions
4. **Validation**: Compare LLM responses with actual data analysis
5. **Documentation**: Record all interactions, successes, and failures

## Key Research Questions
- Basic: "How many games did the team play?"
- Intermediate: "Who was the most improved player this season?"
- Advanced: "As a coach, should I focus on offense or defense to win 2 more games next season?"

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Setup and dataset selection (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Basic analysis and validation (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced prompt engineering (Week 2-3)
- **Phase 4**: Complex analysis and visualizations (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 5**: Documentation and reporting (Week 4)
