# Phase 1 & 2 Summary: Setup and Data Analysis Complete

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Phase 1: Repository Setup and Dataset Selection
1. **Repository Structure Created**
   - Organized folder structure (`data/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/`, `documentation/`, `results/`)
   - Comprehensive README.md with project overview
   - .gitignore configured to exclude dataset files
   - Requirements.txt with necessary Python dependencies

2. **Dataset Selected and Analyzed**
   - **Syracuse Women's Basketball 2023-24** dataset
   - 11 players, 32 games, 22 statistical columns
   - Rich basketball statistics (scoring, shooting, rebounds, assists, etc.)
   - Perfect size for LLM testing (small but comprehensive)
   - Season context: 24-8 record, #20 AP ranking, NCAA tournament

### Phase 2: Data Analysis and Baseline Statistics
1. **Specialized Basketball Analyzer Created**
   - `scripts/basketball_analyzer.py` - Comprehensive analysis tool
   - Functions for team stats, player rankings, position analysis, efficiency metrics
   - Visualization generation (4 charts created)
   - JSON export for LLM validation

2. **Baseline Analysis Generated**
   - **Team Statistics:** 24-8 record, 32 games, team averages
   - **Player Rankings:** Top scorers, rebounders, assist leaders, etc.
   - **Position Analysis:** Performance by Guard, Forward, Center
   - **Efficiency Metrics:** Custom efficiency ratings and improvement candidates
   - **Visualizations:** Top scorers chart, position distribution, shooting efficiency, player comparison radar

3. **Prompt Collection Framework**
   - `prompts/basketball_prompts.md` - Basketball-specific prompts
   - Organized by difficulty: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced
   - Includes expected answers for validation
   - Covers team overview, player analysis, strategic coaching decisions

## üìä Key Statistics from Analysis

## üéØ Next Steps: Phase 3 - LLM Testing

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Test Basic Questions with LLMs**
   - Use prompts from `prompts/basketball_prompts.md`
   - Test with ChatGPT, Claude, and Co-Pilot
   - Document accuracy and response quality

2. **Create LLM Response Tracking**
   - Document each LLM interaction
   - Compare responses with baseline analysis
   - Note areas of success and failure

3. **Develop Prompt Engineering Strategies**
   - Refine prompts based on initial results
   - Test different ways of presenting data to LLMs
   - Experiment with context and formatting

### Research Questions to Address
1. **Basic Questions (Expected High Accuracy)**
   - How many players are on the team?
   - Who is the leading scorer?
   - What is the team's record?

2. **Intermediate Questions (Testing Analysis)**
   - Who are the most efficient players?
   - Which position performs best?
   - What are the team's strengths?

3. **Advanced Questions (Complex Analysis)**
   - Who is the most improved player?
   - Should coaching focus on offense or defense?
   - Which player should be the "game changer"?

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Success Metrics
- **Basic Questions:** 90%+ accuracy expected
- **Intermediate Questions:** 70-80% accuracy expected
- **Advanced Questions:** 50-70% accuracy expected
- **Visualizations:** Limited success expected

### Key Learnings to Document
- LLM strengths and weaknesses in sports data analysis
- Effective prompt engineering strategies
- Areas where LLMs struggle with complex reasoning
- Comparison of different LLM capabilities

## üîÑ Timeline
- **Week 1:** Complete LLM testing with basic questions
- **Week 2:** Progress to intermediate and advanced questions
- **Week 3:** Refine prompts and document findings
- **Week 4:** Final analysis and report preparation
