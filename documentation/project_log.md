# Project Log - Task 05: Descriptive Statistics and LLMs

## Project Start: [Current Date]

### Phase 1: Setup and Dataset Selection

#### Repository Setup âœ…
- Created organized folder structure
- Set up comprehensive README.md
- Established documentation framework

#### Dataset Selection (In Progress)
- **Options Considered:**
  1. SU Women's Lacrosse data (as mentioned in instructions)
  2. Cricket team data (personal preference option)
  3. Other SU sports team data

- **Criteria for Selection:**
  - Small dataset size (to avoid high LLM costs)
  - Rich statistical information
  - Availability and accessibility
  - Potential for complex analytical questions

#### Next Steps:
1. Research and select specific dataset
2. Download and prepare dataset
3. Create initial data processing scripts
4. Begin basic descriptive statistics analysis

## Research Questions to Explore

### Basic Questions (Easy for LLMs)
- How many games did the team play?
- What was the team's win-loss record?
- Who scored the most points/goals?
- What was the average score per game?

### Intermediate Questions (Require Analysis)
- Who was the most improved player?
- Which games were the closest/most lopsided?
- What was the team's performance trend over the season?
- Who were the most consistent performers?

### Advanced Questions (Complex Analysis)
- As a coach, should I focus on offense or defense to win 2 more games?
- Which player should I work with to be a game changer?
- What factors contributed most to wins vs losses?
- How would the season have been different if we had won specific close games?

## LLM Testing Strategy

### LLMs to Test:
1. **ChatGPT** (GPT-4)
2. **Claude** (Anthropic)
3. **Co-Pilot** (GitHub)

### Testing Approach:
1. Start with basic questions
2. Document initial accuracy
3. Refine prompts based on results
4. Progress to complex questions
5. Validate all responses against actual data
